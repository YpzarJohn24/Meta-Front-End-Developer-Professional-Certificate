# Advanced React

Learn how to use more advanced React concepts and features, become proficient in JSX, and confidently test your applications.

You’ll examine different types of React components and learn various characteristics and when to use them. You’ll dig into more advanced hooks and create your own. You’ll look into building forms with React. You’ll explore component composition and new patterns, such as Higher Order Components and Render Props. You’ll create a web application that consumes API data and get familiar with the most commonly used React framework integrations, tools, and testing techniques.

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

- Render lists and form components efficiently in React.
- Lift shared state up when several components need the updated data.
- Leverage React Context to share global state for a tree of components.
- Fetch data from a remote server.
- Use advanced hooks in React, and put them to use within your application.
- Build your own custom hooks.
- Understand JSX in depth.
- Embrace component composition techniques
- Use advanced patterns to encapsulate common behavior via Higher Order Components and Render Props.
- Test your React components.
- Build a portfolio using React.

You’ll gain experience with the following tools and software:

- React.js
- JSX
- React
- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- VSCode

You will be able to leverage the potential of this course to develop new skills, improve productivity, act effectively with data and boost your career.

To take this course, you should understand the basics of React, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Additionally, it always helps to have a can-do attitude!

### Module 1: Components

Learn how to render list and form components efficiently in React, and learn how to lift a shared state up when several components need the updated data.

<b>Learning Objectives</b>

- Render and transform lists with keys in React.
- Distinguish between controlled and uncontrolled React components.
- Create a controlled form component in React.
- Share component state by lifting state up to the closest common ancestor
- Share global state using React Context

### Module 2: React Hooks and Custom Hooks

Learn to use all the common hooks in React, and how to put them to use within your application. Then, build your own custom hooks.

<b>Learning Objectives</b>

- Explain the uses and purpose of React hooks.
- Use the useState hook to declare, read and update the state of a component.
- Use the useEffect hook to perform side-effects within a React component.
- Use hooks to fetch data in React.
- Create appropriate custom hooks in React.

### Module 3: JSX and testing

Understand JSX in depth and discover advanced patterns to encapsulate common behaviour via higher-order components and render props. Then, learn how to test and debug your application.

<b>Learning Objectives</b>

- Define the types of children within JSX
- Use JSX to apply React component composition with children.
- Describe the process and purpose of creating higher-order components.
- Describe the process and purpose of creating render props.
- Write a test for a React application using Jest and React Testing Library.

### Module 4: Final project
