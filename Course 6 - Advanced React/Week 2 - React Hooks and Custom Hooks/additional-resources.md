# Additional Resources

## Getting started with hooks

Below is a list of additional resources as you continue to explore React hooks and custom hooks.

In particular, to complement your learning in the “Getting started with hooks” lesson, you can work through the following:

- The article on [destructuring](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) assignment describes how the destructuring assignment, which allows you to get values out of the array that gets returned when the `useState` hook is invoked, works in more detail.

- [The read props inside the child component](https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component#step-2-read-props-inside-the-child-component) link on the Beta version of React docs discusses how to use destructuring assignment to get values out of the props object.

- The [useState reference on official React docs website](https://react.dev/apis/react/useState#usestate) helps you understand how to work with this hook and some of the caveats involved.

- The [useEffect reference on official React docs website](https://react.dev/apis/react/useEffect#useeffect) helps you understand the syntax of this hook and goes into some depth to explain how to use and troubleshoot the `useEffect` hook.

## Rules of Hooks and Fetching Data with Hooks

Below is a list of additional resources as you continue to explore React hooks and custom hooks.

In particular, to complement your learning on the 'Rules of hooks and fetching data with hooks' lesson, you can work through the following:

- The [Rules of Hooks reading on Reactjs.org](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html) website gives you an overview of how to work with the hooks as recommended by the React Core team at Meta.

- The [Fetching data with Effects](https://react.dev/apis/react/useEffect#fetching-data-with-effects) article on React docs discusses fetching data using a few different approaches, including using async / await syntax.

- [How to use promises](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Promises) is a resource that describes the "behind-the-scenes" of how data fetching works in greater depth.

- [async function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) is a resource on MDN that discusses the use of the async and await keywords as a more recent way to handle API requests in JavaScript.

## Advanced hooks

Below is a list of additional readings as you continue to explore 'React hooks and custom hooks'.

In particular, to complement your learning in the 'Advanced hooks' lesson, you can work through the following:

- The [useReducer hook reference](https://react.dev/reference/react/useReducer) in the React docs discusses the basics of `useReducer`, along with specifying initial state and lazy initialization.

- The React docs also has a reference on [using the useRef hook](https://react.dev/reference/react/useRef) which is a great example of various options that are available when working with the `useRef` hook.

- The [Reusing Logic with Custom Hooks](https://react.dev/learn/reusing-logic-with-custom-hooks) reference in the React docs discusses the dynamics of custom hooks and provides a few practical examples to complement the theory behind them.
