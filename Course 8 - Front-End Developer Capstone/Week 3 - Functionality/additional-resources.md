# Additional Resources

## Table Booking System

Here is a list of resources in the form of additional reading materials that will help you gain more insight into project functionality related to the table booking system of your app project.

- The article on [destructuring assignment](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment) syntax allows you to get values out of the array that are returned when the `useState` hook is invoked. This resource describes how the destructuring assignment works in more detail.

- The [Read props inside the child component](https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component#step-2-read-props-inside-the-child-component) link on the Beta version of React docs discusses how to use destructuring assignment to get values out of the props object.

- The [useState reference](https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component#step-2-read-props-inside-the-child-component) on the official React docs website helps you to understand how to work with this hook and some of the caveats involved.

- The [useEffect reference](https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component#step-2-read-props-inside-the-child-component) on the official React docs website helps you to understand the syntax of this hook and goes into some depth to explain how to use and troubleshoot the `useEffect` hook.

- The [rules of hooks](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-rules.html) reading on the reactjs.org website gives you an overview of how to work with the hooks as recommended by the React Core team at Meta.

- The [useReducer hook](https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/hooks-reference.html#usereducer) reference on the reactjs.org website discusses the basics of `useReducer`, along with specifying initial state and lazy initialization.

- The [syntax and usage of the useReducer hook](https://react.dev/apis/react/useReducer#usereducer) reading on the reactjs.org website complements the previous additional resource well.

- The [using the useRef hook reference](https://react.dev/apis/react/useRef#useref) on the reactjs.org's docs website is a great example of various options that are available when working with this hook.

- The [reusing logic with custom hooks](https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component#step-2-read-props-inside-the-child-component) on reactjs.org discusses the dynamics of custom hooks and goes to some length in giving a few practical examples to complement the theory behind them.
