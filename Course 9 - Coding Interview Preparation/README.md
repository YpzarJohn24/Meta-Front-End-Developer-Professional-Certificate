### Module 1: Introduction to the coding interview

In this introductory module, you'll learn about a coding interview, what it could consist of, and the types of coding interviews you might encounter. You’ll learn about how to prepare for a coding interview, focusing on communication and working with pseudocode. You will also get an introduction to computer science, including the fundamental concepts of Binary, Big O notation, and time and space complexity.

<b>Learning Objectives</b>

- Grasp the fundamentals of computer science
- Recognize the role pseudocode plays in coding interviews
- Identify the core components that you will need to prepare for the interview process
- Identify strategies for successful interviewing

### Module 2: Introduction to Data Structures

The second module of this course covers data structures. You'll learn about the implementation and capabilities of data structures between various programming languages and the similar patterns of the overarching architecture. You will learn about basic data structures, such as strings, integers, arrays and objects, before moving on to collection data structures, including lists, stacks and trees, and advanced data structures, such as hash tables, heaps and graphs.

<b>Learning Objectives</b>

- Review data structures in context with coding interviews
- Introduce new data structures that are commonly found in coding interviews

### Module 3: Introduction to Algorithms

In this module, you'll learn about algorithms. You'll cover common approaches to sorting and searching with algorithms. You’ll also explore the time and space complexity aspects of both sorting and searching. You will then learn more about working with algorithms, demonstrating how to visualize and problem solve with algorithmic approaches, such as divide and conquer, greedy algorithms and dynamic programming.

<b>Learning Objectives</b>

- Introduce the concept and usage of algorithms
- Demonstrate how to visualize an algorithm
- Combine new and previously learned coding patterns to solve problems

### Module 4: Final project

In this module, you will be assessed on the key concepts and topics covered in the course.

<b>Learning Objectives</b>

- Apply your knowledge of the key concepts and topics
- Reflect on this course's content and on the learning path that lies ahead
