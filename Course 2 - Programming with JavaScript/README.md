- Build and use objects, arrays, and functions
- List some common built-in methods on built-in objects
- Describe handling bugs and errors using try, catch, throw, and defensive programming
- Explain the difference between undefined, null, and empty strings
- Demonstrate how to write basic code using arrays, objects, and functions

### Module 3: Programming Paradigms

This module is about functional programming and the oriented programming paradigm. You will learn what scope is in JavaScript. You'll explore the differences between var, let and const. And you'll learn how to use classes and inheritance in object oriented programming. Additionally, you'll explore how to use write JavaScript using modern features like spread and rest. You will build code that can manipulate the DOM and handle events. And you will use JSON in JavaScript. After completing this module, you will be able to:
