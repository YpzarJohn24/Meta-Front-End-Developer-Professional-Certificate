# Module quiz: Design and test

1. The purpose of a wireframe is to create a basic structure for each screen in the design before things like branding, colors and images are considered.
    - True
    - False
    ```
    Answer: True
    Explanation: The purpose of a wireframe is to create a basic structure for each screen in the design before things like branding, colors and images are considered. 
    ```

2. What is involved in usability testing? Select all that apply. 
    - A Letter of Consent
    - A test script
    - Tasks 
    - Personas
    - A facilitator or researcher
    - Participants
    ```
    Answer: A Letter of Consent
            A test script
            Tasks 
            A facilitator or researcher
            Participants
    Explanation: If the usability test is being recorded, you need a letter of consent from the participants.
                 You should prepare a test script that aligns with your testing objectives.
                 Users are given tasks to perform while being observed by a facilitator to see where they run into difficulties or become confused. If many people run into the same issues, recommendations can be made to fix these usability issues. It offers opportunities to make improvements.
                 A facilitator or researcher is a person who facilitates the usability test.
                 The participants in usability testing use a website, app or other product you've designed while tracking their actions and reactions. 
    ```

3. Usability testing cannot be done online.
    - True
    - False
    ```
    Answer: False
    Explanation: Online testing is widespread because in-person research usually requires more time and money. You can have moderated and unmoderated online usability testing. 
    ```

4. What are the advantages of rapid prototyping? Select all that apply.
    - Addresses and solves problems
    - Validates a product section in a relatively short period
    - Identifies problems or pain points early in the design process
    - Provides the user with visuals
    ```
    Answer: Addresses and solves problems
            Validates a product section in a relatively short period
            Identifies problems or pain points early in the design process
            Provides the user with visuals
    Explanation: It allows us to address and solve problems before they reach development further along in the process, saving us valuable time and money.
                 You build a prototype of a product section that you want to validate in a relatively short period. You then show it to users or your team for feedback and make changes based on their responses. This process allows you to collect feedback early and frequently and build better products faster. 
                 Rapid prototyping also allows us to identify issues or pain points early in the design process.
                 Rapid prototyping provides us with visuals to ensure everyone is on the same page. It is not the same thing to describe a product as it is to see it.
    ```

5. You should not name your layers in Figma.
    - True
    - False
    ```
    Answer: False
    Explanation: The best practice is to name your layers in Figma, as this assists you with organizing and identifying your layers.  Designers are sometimes tempted to leave their layers panel looking like organized chaos, making it difficult to find things. Figma documents can become overly complex, so itâ€™s best to name your layers.
    ```

6. Is there a difference between Groups and Frames in Figma?
    - Yes
    - No
    ```
    Answer: Yes
    Explanation: Groups are defined by their contents. Your group's boundaries are the outer edges of whatever is inside. On the other hand, the boundaries of your frame are independent of what's inside. 
    ```

7. Which of the following are fidelity levels in prototyping?
    - High-fidelity
    - Low-fidelity
    - Mid-fidelity
    - No-fidelity
    ```
    Answer: High-fidelity
            Low-fidelity
            Mid-fidelity
    Explanation: High-fidelity prototypes, which closely resemble the finished product, tend to focus on visual design.
                 Low-fidelity prototypes allow users to concentrate on how they will use a product.
                 Mid-fidelity prototypes allow users to concentrate on interactivity. They aid in the validation of element and screen behavior. These are frequently created using wireframes. 
    ```

8. Constraints help maintain consistent spacing across different container sizes and configuring resizing behavior.
    - True
    - False
    ```
    Answer: True
    Explanation: Constraints help maintain consistent spacing across different container sizes and configuring resizing behavior.
    ```

9. A grid is the intersection of rows and columns that create units of space. Each design element (text, images or buttons) fits into modules.
    - True
    - False
    ```
    Answer: False
    Explanation: A module is the intersection of rows and columns that create units of space. Each design element (text, images or buttons) fits into modules.
    ```

10. Which of these elements are included in typography terminology? Select all that apply.
    - Cap Height
    - Calibri
    - Arial
    - Kerning
    - Weight
    - Baseline
    ```
    Answer: Cap Height 
            Kerning 
            Weight
            Baseline
    Explanation: The cap height of a typeface refers to the height of the capital letters. The cap height indicates the height of flat letters such as M, H, T, or I, as opposed to round letters such as S, O or Q, or pointy letters such as A and V, which overshoot. It should be noted that the cap height is less than the typeface's maximum height.
                 Kerning is the space that exists between two specific letters. It differs from tracking in that it does not apply to all characters. 
                 The overall thickness of a typeface's stroke is referred to as its weight. Weights can range from extremely light to extremely heavy.
                 The baseline is the point at which the text line rests. It calculates the distance between the written content and other elements on the interface.
