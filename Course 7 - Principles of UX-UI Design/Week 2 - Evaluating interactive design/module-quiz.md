2. Who wrote the 10 Usability Heuristics for UI design?
    - Ben Shneiderman
    - Dieter Rams
    - Jakob Nielsen
    ```
    Answer: Jakob Nielsen

3. Should a form field have a minimum character count, for example, a first name with three characters?
    - Yes
    - No
    ```
    Answer: No
    Explanation: At least 220 three-character names exist. In some ways, this is dehumanizing because the system regards someone as unreal or invalid. 
    ```

4. Which of these form-field labels are necessary? Select all that apply. 
    - Optional 
    - Fail feedback
    - Required
    ```
    Answer: Optional 
            Fail feedback
            Required
    Explanation: Optional fields should be labeled so users know they can be skipped.
                 Including fail feedback highlights errors such as empty required fields or an invalid email. For example, when the email lacks an '@' sign.
                 Providing an asterisk or the text required indicates that a form field is required.
    ```

5. Is the following statement one of Dieter Rams’ 10 Principles of Good Design?
    “Good design is as little design as possible.” 
    - Yes
    - No
    ```
    Answer: Yes
    Explanation: Design should always be intentional. Anything that doesn’t serve a purpose for the user should be excluded. With less clutter, a design will achieve more clarity for the user. 
    ```

6. Is the following statement one of Dieter Rams’ 10 Principles of Good Design?
    “Strive for consistency.” 
    - Yes
    - No
    ```
    Answer: No
    Explanation: This is one of Shneiderman’s 8 Golden Rules of UI Design. It is critical to maintain uniformity throughout the site, whether it's the layout, the size of the button, the color code or the tone used when writing the page.
    ```

7. What is a severity rating in a heuristic evaluation?
    - It’s a score of how well the item lines up with a heuristic.
    - It defines a score between zero and four to indicate how much it violates a heuristic.
    ```
    Answer: It defines a score between zero and four to indicate how much it violates a heuristic.
    Explanation: It identifies whether the heuristic is superficial, minor, major or a catastrophic violation.
    ```

8. What is an error rating?
    - It’s a score of how badly the item lines up with a heuristic.
    - It defines a score between zero and four to indicate how easily the violation may be fixed.
    ```
    Answer: It defines a score between zero and four to indicate how easily the violation may be fixed.
    Explanation: It identifies whether the heuristic is maximum effort, considerable effort, concentrated effort, easy or trivial effort.
    ```
